🌍 Predicting Carbon Emissions of Countries Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the carbon dioxide emissions (CO₂) of different countries using socio-economic and environmental indicators. The goal is to support policy-makers and researchers in climate impact assessments and decision-making.
📌 Project Overview

With increasing global concerns about climate change, accurately predicting CO₂ emissions is critical. This project uses publicly available datasets to build regression models that can forecast a country's carbon emissions based on features like:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Energy Consumption
Population
Urbanization Rate

Renewable Energy Usage
🎯 Objectives
Analyze historical data of carbon emissions.
Identify key features affecting emissions.
Train and evaluate machine learning models.
Predict emissions for unseen country data.

Visualize and interpret model results.
